# Debrief on e-voting in Estonia

This is a fork of [a report on e-voting](https://www.mkm.ee/et/eesmargid-tegevused/infouhiskond/kuberturvalisus#evalimised) by government working group in the end of 2019. As a working group member I was not satisfied with the quality of the discussions but even more with the result, which failed to endorse any architectural changes to e-voting. This site is intendeded to fork and fix the failed official report in a manner comprehensible to local and international audiences, but also provide requirements to measure the future progress with e-voting in Estonia.

Some of the background:

* [Debrief on e-voting in Estonia](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Session:Debrief_on_e-voting_in_Estonia) (presentation @36c3, slides)
* [Member of e-voting working group: for me the report was a failure](https://digi.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/e-valimiste-tooruhma-liige-loppraport-on-minu-jaoks-labikukkumine/) (in Estonian)
* [Kingo's working group discovered 25 spots of worry in e-voting](https://tehnika.postimees.ee/6848342/loe-taismahus-kingo-tooruhm-avastas-e-valimistel-25-murekohta) (in Estonian)

## Scaling the report into e-voting index

My bold goal would be to scale my debrief forked from official report into an index of e-voting systems. I am composing my initial list of requirements keeping in mind that they will be modified, restructured and possibly forked for other purposes.

Some of the background:

* [Netizen index of e-voting requirements](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Projects:Netizen_index_of_e-voting_requirements) (project blueprint @36c3)
