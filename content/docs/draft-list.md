I find these loosely differentiated categories meaningful to set requirements for Estonian e-voting. For input I mostly used:

* [Handbook for the Observation of New Voting Technologies](https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/104939) (2013)
* [OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights election reports on Estonia](https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/estonia/) (2007, 2011, 2015, 2019)
* [The Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2017)5 on Standards for E-voting](https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=0900001680726f6f) (2017)
* [A framework for comparing the security of voting schemes](https://www.attejuvonen.fi/thesis/) (2019)
* [End-to-end election verifiability for a nontechnical audience](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03778) (2014)
* [Verifiability Notions for E-Voting Protocols](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/287) (2016)
* [The Future of Voting: End-to-end Verifiable Internet Voting. Specification and Feasibility Assessment Study](https://github.com/GaloisInc/e2eviv/blob/master/report/E2EVIV_full_report.pdf) (2015)

Under each of the cateogries I intend to write detailed accounts quoting relevant reports and documents.

## Legal


## Verification


## Safeguards


## Development


## Technology


## Procedure


## Standards
